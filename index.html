    It’s emerging as a must-visit tourist spot in the province and is also one of the top beaches in Cebu. Don’t forget to take photos of the sunset as it’s a breathtaking sight to see.  </p>

  <h2>Antonia Beach</h2>
  <p>
    Islas de Gigantes or Gigantes Islands in Iloilo, Visayas have been gaining popularity in the recent years. That's because the crystal clear waters and powdery white sand of Antonia Beach is a sight to behold!

    It’s one of those remote beaches where you can laze around and swim all day without the big crowd compared to the more popular beaches in the country. 
    
    Just off the shoreline on the northern part of the beach you’ll find colorful fish, corals, seagrass, and other types of marine life that can be clearly seen even without snorkeling gear, although if you want a closer look you can always rent one out for a small fee.

  <h2>Morong Beach</h2>
  <p>
    Aside from its rolling hills, lighthouses, and stone houses, the small archipelagic province of Batanes in the northernmost part of the Philippines is also home to Morong Beach.

    Also called Nakabuang Beach, its most prominent feature is the massive rocky arch called Nakabuang Arch, making it one of the most photographed spots in Batanes.
    
    The glass-like water in Morong Beach is calmer and friendlier despite the usual rough weather. The best way to enjoy Morong Beach is by joining a Sabtang Island day tour. You can even tour the island in a more rugged experience by joining a tricycle excursion of Sabtang Island.
